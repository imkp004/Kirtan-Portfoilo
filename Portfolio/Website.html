            <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
            <p>This purpose of this page is to show what I have learned and what projects I made 
                in this semester class. By creating this projects I have learned and changed the
                layout by thinking about the image of how would finished website would look like.
                It helped me made myself more creative. Not only just I learned about html and css
                my creativity of makeing webpages is improveing day by day as I create more.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Restaurant</li>
                    <li>Information</li>
                    <li>Eportfolio</li>
                </ul><p>
                There are three projects I have made in this semester and those are all listed here and I 
                have also included their information. The underlined text is the link which will 
                directly take you to the project's page.

            <h3>Project 1 - <a href="HW5/HomePage.html">Restaurant</a></h3>
            <img src="image2.png" alt="restaurant" width="400" height="200"">
            <p>This is the first project that I have created in this class. When I 
                started making it and when I finished it is complete opposite of what
                it looked and what I imagined it to be. Though it is not perfect it has 
                lot of mistakes which I improved and still need to improve.
            </p>
            <p>It has house speciality page, and entertainment page which has variety of 
                styles and editing in it. I have learned and created a table also aligning the 
                text with the image. This is when I started thinking creative and used it to make 
                this project.
            </p>

                <h3>Project 2 - <a href="Project/home.html">Informational Project</a></h3>
                <img src="image3.png" alt="Information" width="400" height="200"">
                <p>In this project I have created an site where people can learn and nagivate around
                    the information which I have provide. It is about booking or planning a trip 
                    which gives a good iden on the place to travel called Delhi. It has five 
                    webpages that are helpful to the people who needs the information.
                </p>
                <p>It worked well creating it because I already had experience with creating a project
                    before. If I had more time I would give more details and edit the page so, that 
                    people can understand the information better. It helped me understand how to create 
                    the form, better aligning the objects, buttons.
                </p>

                <h3>Project 3 - <a href="homepage.html">Eportfoilo</a></h3>
                <img src="image4.png" alt="eportfolio" width="400" height="200"">
                <p>In this project I am creating a eportfolio of my own and stating all the things
                    that I have learned so far in the class, and also little bit about myself.
                    By creating other projects before this one I did't had much time thinking about 
                    how it would look like because I had a clear picture of what and how I should make
                    this webpage more attractive and understandable.
                </p>
                <p>I am makeing three webpages in total which give my information such as my 
                    resume, my contact info, my projects that I have created, and skills which 
                    I developed in this semester.
