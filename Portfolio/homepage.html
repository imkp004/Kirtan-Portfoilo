            <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
                <p>I have learned a lot from this fall 2022 semester class. The HyperText Markup Language. (HTML)
                    and CSS for editing and creating the webpage can be very helpful in real life by simply making
                    such as introducing, advertising, informing, and helping sites. JavaScript is also a intersting 
                    thing to learn about it has lot of features which I have learned and implemented in the exercises.
                    I created projects in this semester which a good way to learn about this launguage. My purpose of
                    this portfolio is to gather and implement what I have studied in this class and reflect upon them.
