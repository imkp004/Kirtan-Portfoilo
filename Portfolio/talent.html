                <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
                <p>By talking to different types of people at my over past years, I have learned and 
                    accomplished good communication skills which helped me better understanding other
                    people. I have gained knowledge in communicating by listining to others, noticing
                    nonverbal cues, and practicing oral communication. It helped me in giving interviews 
                    for high level job position and it is very important to have that skill in workplace.
                </p>
                    <p>
                    By doing different types of jobs I have learned and understood that what people needs
                    more than knowlegde is an communication which comes in hand for any type of job. Learning
                    how to present, active listining, feedback, respect, confidence, clarity, honesty, and 
                    public speaking can help in any trouble situation in any job.

                <h3>EXAMPLES</h3>
                <p><ol><li>One of the best ways to effectively communicate is to listen well. 
                    Everyone dislikes speaking with someone who only wants to add their two 
                    cents and doesn't take the time to listen to the other person. It will be 
                    difficult for you to understand what is being requested of you if you are
                     not a good listener.</li>
                    <li>Active listening requires paying great attention to what the other 
                        person is saying, seeking clarification, and reframing what they say
                         to make sure that they are understood. You can answer more effectively
                          when you actively listen to the other person's words and ideas.</li>
                    <li>Not talking too much or too little is the key to effective verbal 
                        communication. Consider using as few words as you can to communicate 
                        your ideas. When chatting to someone in person, on the phone, or via 
                        email, be sure to express your needs and desires in a clear and concise
                         manner. If you drone on, your audience will either stop paying attention 
                         to you or won't be certain of your exact objectives.</li>
                    <li>Your coworkers will feel more comfortable speaking openly and honestly 
                        with you if you use a pleasant tone, ask a personal question, or simply
                         smile at them. It's crucial to use good manners in all of your communications 
                         at work.</li>
                    <li>Respecting others and their opinions will make people more receptive to
                         your communication. The person will feel valued if you take the time to 
                         address them by name, make eye contact, and listen intently while they talk.
                          Keep your attention on the conversation at hand while on the phone.</li>
                    </ol>
